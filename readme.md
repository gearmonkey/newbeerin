New Beer In ____
================

A twitter bot that classifies tweets (to segregate the ones that are 'on the bar' tweets), then a rule-system hack to break the tweets into beers, and tweet the new ones.

To use it yourself, you'd need to train up a classifier. Then associate it with a twitter account.

Uses the friends feed as input, so you can curate the tweets via the followers.
